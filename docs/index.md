# gitlabcommit Provider

This provider can add one or more files using the `for_each` meta-argument on `gitlabcommits_file`resource.

# Motivation

As of writing there is one pull request for adding file resource for the offical Gitlab terraform provider, but is has a
limitation of only being able to add one file at a time or set `-parallelism=1`. This provider collects create, update
and delete actions and commits all changes in one commit.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    gitlabcommit = {
      source  = "akselleirv/gitlabcommit"
      version = ">=0.0.3"
    }
  }
}

variable "gitlab_api_token" {
  type = string
}

variable "project_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "files" {
  type = list(string) // a list of file paths
}

provider "gitlabcommit" {
  gitlab_api_token = var.gitlab_api_token
  project_id       = var.project_id
  branch           = "main"
  author_email     = "akselleirv@example.com"
  author_name      = "Aksel"
  commit_message   = "I can add many files!"
}


resource "gitlabcommit_file" "example" {
  for_each  = {for idx, filepath in var.files : filepath => "content #${idx} - ${uuid()}"}
  file_path = each.key
  content   = each.value
}
```
